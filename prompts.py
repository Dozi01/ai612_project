answerable_classification_user_prompt = """Your task is to classify the following user question as answerable or unanswerable based on the SQL tables and the assumptions:

### [Unanswerable questions]
- Vague questions
- Questions that have nothing to do with medical data
- Questions that are plausible but with no related table.

### [Answerable questions]
- Questions that are answerable with the given tables

### Here are some examples of answerable questions and the reason for why they are answerable:
"Can you list the yearly maximum vital high protein (full) input of patient 10019777?"
- The question is answerable because the d_items table links "vital high protein (full)" to inputevents, which records totalamount and starttime. The SQL query can be generated to correctly filters by patient ID, groups by year, and calculates the maximum input.
"What were the top five most common output events since 2100?"
- The question is answerable because "since 2100" includes all timestamps from the year 2100 onward, not just future data. If the dataset contains records from 2100 or later, valid results can be retrieved. 
"What is the number of times that patient 10018081 had ostomy (output) since 12/03/2100?"
- The question is answerable because "ostomy (output)" is a recorded event in the dataset, and the required patient identification and time filtering can be performed using available tables. The term "ostomy (output)" exists in the data schema, making it possible to count occurrences.

### And these examples of unanswerable questions:
"What is the meaning of life?"
"Who is the best basketball player of all time?"
"Is the sky blue?"

Finally, assign a score from 0 to 100 indicating how answerable the question is, where:
- 0 means completely unanswerable, which is vauge, or unrelated to the tables
- 50 means partially answerable or requires additional columns or data
- 100 means fully answerable with the given data

Present your response in the following format:

<analysis>
[Your detailed reasoning here]
</analysis>

<score>
[Your numerical score from 0 to 100]
</score>

Remember to provide thorough reasoning before giving the final score.
